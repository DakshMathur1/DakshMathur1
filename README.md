## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daksh, a third-year Computer Science (Co-op) and Economics (Minor) student at the University of British Columbia. 

I am deeply passionate about Data Analytics/Data Science, Machine Learning & Software Development. I am proficient in SQL, Python, R, Java (OOP), C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as demonstrated through my numerous projects.

I enjoy solving complex, time-sensitive problems, which has led me to excel in numerous Datathons, Hackathons, and Case Competitions over the past few years. I completed my first internship as an Algorithmic Trading Intern in Singapore, where I back-tested & engineered automated live-trading algorithms for deployment in the financial market.

I am now seeking Fall 2025 Co-op opportunities in Data Analytics/Data Science or Software Development, ideally within the Data, Fintech, or Technology sectors.
